# Tenjin

Tenjin is a structured course outline tool for the [Sakai](https://sakaiproject.org/) Learning Management System developped and maintained by HEC Montreal.

# Build

Adding Tenjin to your Sakai build should be as easy as cloning this repository to your Sakai project directory and adding `<module>tenjin</module>` to your master pom.xml file (asuming tenjin is the name of the directory containing the code).
